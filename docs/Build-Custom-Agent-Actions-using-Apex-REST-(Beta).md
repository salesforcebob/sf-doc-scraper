# Build Custom Agent Actions using Apex REST (Beta)

Use generative AI to quickly create an OpenAPI document for your Apex REST class and activate the API for use in Agentforce. Deploy the class, the OpenAPI document, and associated metadata to your org’s API catalog. Then create an agent action in Agentforce Builder in your org that’s based on methods in the class.

## Generate an OpenAPI Specification (OAS) for an Apex REST Class

Salesforce's OpenAPI Specification (OAS) generation feature uses the [Agentforce Vibes Extension](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/einstein-for-devs/guide/einstein-overview.html). Agentforce Vibes Extension is an AI-powered extension built using `CodeGen` and `xGen-Code`, secure, custom AI models from Salesforce. This feature generates OpenAPI v3 Specifications for Apex classes that define a REST resource. You can then deploy the generated OAS to add it to the Salesforce API catalog. The API then becomes available as custom actions and can be used by Agentforce agents to enhance their capabilities.
