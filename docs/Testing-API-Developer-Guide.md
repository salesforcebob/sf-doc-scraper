# Testing API Developer Guide

To launch an agent that’s trustworthy and reliable, it must be thoroughly tested. Agentforce Builder is well suited for testing out a conversation, but if you want to test many utterances, the process can be time-consuming. With Testing API, you can programmatically build out tests that automate the evaluation process and assess many requests in a short amount of time. By reducing testing time, you can activate trusted agents quickly.

Use Testing API to batch test your AI agents and access Agentforce Testing Center.

> **Tip:**
> 
> The Testing API uses a REST API. To test agents using the Salesforce UI, see the [Agentforce Testing Center](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ai.agent_testing_center.htm). To test agents with a command-line tool or with a VS Code extension, see [Agentforce DX](/docs/einstein/genai/guide/agent-dx.html).
