# Overview

The Agentforce Mobile SDK empowers you to integrate Salesforce's feature-rich, trusted AI platform with your native iOS and Android mobile applications. By leveraging the Agentforce Mobile SDK, you can deliver cutting-edge, intelligent, and conversational AI experiences to your mobile users, enhancing engagement and providing seamless access to information and actions.

## What is Agentforce?

Agentforce is Salesforce's platform for building and deploying trusted AI agents. These agents can understand user requests, access relevant data, perform actions across Salesforce and external systems, and generate helpful, conversational responses. The Agentforce Mobile SDK acts as the bridge, allowing your mobile app to communicate directly with these sophisticated agents, bringing the power of generative AI and automated workflows to your users' fingertips.

## Why Use the Agentforce Mobile SDK?

Integrating the Agentforce Mobile SDK into your app offers several key advantages. It allows you to deliver advanced AI experiences that go beyond simple chatbots, providing users with truly agentic capabilities for complex task completion, personalized interactions, and access to generative AI features within your app's context.

The SDK offers flexible integration options to suit your needs:

-   **Full UI:** Get up and running quickly by using the SDK's pre-built, customizable chat interface. This provides a rich, out-of-the-box conversational experience supporting text, voice, and multimodal inputs with minimal coding effort.
-   **Custom UI:** For ultimate control, choose the headless experience to power your own custom user interface or to drive automated, agent-led processes in the background. You manage the conversational state and UI, while Agentforce handles the complex AI logic.

We suggest starting with the Full UI unless you need more granular control over the interface.

## Key Features

The Agentforce Mobile SDK provides comprehensive capabilities for mobile AI integration.

-   **Conversational Intelligence:** Sophisticated Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to process user requests via text or voice.
-   **Salesforce Actions:** Execute actions within Salesforce, such as creating records, updating fields, and running Apex classes, directly from the conversation.
-   **Customizable UI:** When using the Full UI experience, you can customize the appearance of the chat interface to match your app's branding.
