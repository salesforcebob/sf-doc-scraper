# Manage Agent Script Agents

You can configure, deploy, and test your agents from your Salesforce org, or at the command line with [Agentforce DX](/docs/einstein/genai/guide/agent-dx.html).

## Configure and Deploy Agents

To configure or deploy agents from your org, see [Configure Your Agent](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ai.agent_parent_configure.htm) and [Deploy Your Agents](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ai.agent_parent_deploy.htm) in Salesforce Help.

To configure or deploy agents at the command line, see the [Agentforce DX](/docs/einstein/genai/guide/agent-dx.html) documentation. Also, refer to the [Metadata API types associated with Agentforce](/docs/einstein/genai/references/agents-metadata-tooling/agents-metadata.html).

## Test Agents

There are various ways to test agents. To identify the testing method that is best for your use case, see [Get Started With Testing Agents](/docs/einstein/genai/guide/testing-api-get-started.html).

> **Note:**
> 
> Always test agents again after they're published.
